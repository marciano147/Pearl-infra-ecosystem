```

## App Research Questions

Before building product code, answer these in docs:

1. What does Pearl support natively: payments, OP_RETURN/data, Taproot scripts, multisig, timelocks?
2. What requires indexer/off-chain state: offers, inscriptions, merchant invoices, model marketplace, leaderboards?
3. What requires wallet signing: OTC execution, payment checkout, data anchoring, future dapp connector?
4. What is safe for read-only public APIs vs authenticated/custodial flows?
5. Which first product creates real usage before an extension wallet exists?

## Current Product Direction

- First build infra, not a standalone browser wallet.
- Build app demand before extension wallet: explorer/indexer, Pearl Pay, OTC market tools, compute marketplace interfaces.
- Treat Pearl as UTXO-first unless future research proves smart-contract-like primitives.
